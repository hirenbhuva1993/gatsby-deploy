They are everywhere, from airports and malls to offices and restaurants. However, from time to time advertising and activation agencies do something that goes beyond the routine. Here is a compilation top 10 most innovative digital signage use cases, ever:\r\n<h2>The highest goal by Adidas</h2>\r\nAdidas, launched this campaign in Tokyo, placing the interactive projection 200 meters above the ground. Users had to download an App to throw the football. The campaign was highly popular and was covered by media outlets across the world.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/66039791\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Anti-smoking campaign by Swedish pharmacy Hjartat</h2>\r\nLast year in December Swedish pharmacy Hjartat deployed digital displays equipped with built-in smoke detectors in the streets of Stockholm. The person in the display used to start coughing as soon as someone smoked near the billboard. This campaign was run with the slogan - \"New year, new resolutions\" prompting users to adopt a healthier lifestyle and quit smoking.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Uj-MMAys4M\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>International Women’s Day campaign by Women’s Aid</h2>\r\nWomen’s Aid is a charity working against domestic violence. Launched on International Women’s Day in London, the above campaign depicted a woman badly beaten and bruised. With facial recognition technology, the billboard was able to account how many people were looking at it, and the bruises healed accordingly. The advertisers wanted to convey that taking notice of the issue is the first step towards bringing the change.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEybVOerb9Q\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>NCDV 'Drag Him Away' Campaign</h2>\r\nThe National Centre for Domestic Violence (NCDV), UK also launched an interactive billboard campaign at Euston Station asking people to intervene and stop domestic violence. For interacting with the large screen and “drag the abuser” away, users need to just enter the web address on their smartphones or scan the featured QR code.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEKC-Yu-LeQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Apolosophy by Apotek</h2>\r\nSubway commuters in Stockholm were pleasantly shocked to see this innovative product launch. Ultrasonic sensors were employed to start a video loop as soon as a train arrived near the billboard.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gt_BeYyioKQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>McDonald’s on Piccadilly Circus</h2>\r\nThis campaign perhaps drew its inspiration from the tourists at the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The idea is simple yet very effective in engaging crowds.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjVYVQOOJA8\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Unbelievable Bus Shelter by Pepsi Max</h2>\r\nThis one highlights how Digital Signage can be integrated with Augmented Reality to create mind-blowing effects, and increase engagement. People can be seen shooting a selfie video with the immersive technology.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Go9rf9GmYpM\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Lookup by British Airways</h2>\r\nThis campaign helped British Airways highlight its long list of destinations. To execute it antennae were placed on the roof of nearby buildings. The antennae were designed to pick up data from the transponders of British Airways aircrafts within 200 kilometers and relay it to an application designed for identifying the flights. Few more systems were involved in the backend to ascertain right timing, correct information and also that the information was displayed only when a aircraft was visible to naked eye.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtJx_pZjvzc\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Nike Fuelstation</h2>\r\nIn this campaign motion-sensitive mirrors were used for displaying a pre-recorded footage of local runners wearing products from the store as customers walk past them. Store visitors can also access more information on products or order online using the interactive touchscreens.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3yaVEa2UkM\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<h2>Miami Heat's Xfinity Plaza</h2>\r\nDigital signage can add significant value to aesthetics of any public space. It’s increasingly being employed by architects and designers to create amazing experiences. The Miami HEAT's Xfinity Plaza is one great example of how to convert an unused space into a happening hangout.\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2Eup6ZSQyE\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\nCredencys Solutions Inc is a leading software development services and solutions provider which has helped numerous businesses in their business growth.

They have bigger fish to fry like marketing, sales, supply chain management, enterprise resource planning, and what not. Latest technologies assist them in simplifying the various business processes. One of such technologies is digital signage that has gained immense popularity amongst the companies who aspire to go digital in order to channelize their marketing efforts.\r\n\r\n‘Digital Signage’, it's a promotional, interactive, and informative platform that communicates with the world by displaying the messages on electronic screens. Design breathtaking business banners of single large-format screens or multi-screen videos, larger to the smaller format in all shapes and sizes, shelf edge display and tablet device, free-standing kiosks, and more. Choose one or pick any combination that suits to your core needs.\r\n\r\nThough most of the businesses realized the importance of <a href=\"http://localhost/xynage\">digital signage solutions</a>, still there are a few organizations who do not agree to use the technology. Here, we have listed out a few core and key strategic benefits of having the digital signboard in place.\r\n<h2><strong>Why Should Organizations Seriously Consider The Digital Signage?</strong></h2>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">1. Effective Information Distribution</span></h3>\r\nShare the information across the wider user base using the digital signage software. Let's take an example of the banking sector. When there is any change in a service or product of the bank, they just need to update the information at a single place. Cloud-based digital signage instantly publishes the new data in defined geographical boundaries. Moreover, it is quite easy to update the details in a simple and timely manner, from any remote location using the digital solution.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">2. Brand Awareness</span></h3>\r\nCustomers do not prefer to purchase the products from an unknown brand. They feel faith and reliability while buying from a renowned company. Digital sign board helps organizations in brand building by blowing an air of awareness amongst the target audience. Create an exciting marketing campaign and run it on signage boards installed in retail stores. It allows organizations to reach out the wider customer base and educate them about the quality of products.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">3. Customer Engagement</span></h3>\r\nRelease static or interactive content on the digital signage solutions to boost up interaction with the customers. Static content displays the information on an electronic board such as restaurant menu boards.\r\nWhile interactive content does not only display the information but also allows consumers to interact with the solution through touch. It permits customers to make selections with the act of touching and be a participant rather than a viewer. Best examples of interactive digital signage software are bank ATM, shopping mall, wayfinding display, trade show, self-help applications, etc.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">4. Incremental Sales</span></h3>\r\nCreate effective marketing campaigns for outdoor digital boards to promote your products/services. A brilliant campaign engages the viewers and encourages them to walk into the store. Also, install digital signage solutions in the store at various places to educate customers with the available offers. Eventually, the buyers end up by purchasing the best deal products. Thus, digital sign board drives tremendous customer engagement and generates immense revenue for the business.\r\n\r\nIf you are running a business that releases the updates of products/services on a frequent basis, then endorsing the brand through printed material is not a right option. All your printing efforts and papers are in vain. Digital signage software can save a significant amount of cost by allowing companies to create digital content that is easy to edit and quick to publish.\r\n\r\nWhenever you feel a message is outdated, create the new one and publish it on the digital board. Keep your content always fresh and relevant in order to gain a competitive edge. Thus, it's an extremely flexible and highly cost-effective solution for the companies.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">5. Customer Experience</span></h3>\r\nCustomers like to have quick access to the information about the products/services they are looking for. Digital signage solutions provide them the required insights quickly and effectively. Imagine when the consumers see the digital campaign and realize they exactly want the same product. They immediately visit your store and make a purchase. Digital signage is a great way to earn good words for your brand too.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">6. Display Portfolio and Awards/Recognitions</span></h3>\r\nPublishing customers ratings, reviews, and testimonials on the digital signage solutions, companies can improve the reliability of their products/services. Also, mention the certifications and awards while launching a marketing campaign on digital signage. It increases the credibility of a brand amongst its target market.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">7. Manifest Seasonal Offers and Featured Items</span></h3>\r\nTo gain competitive advantages, companies have to keep updating their products or services on the frequent basis. Releasing seasonal offers and limited time items, brands can keep the customers returning. With digital signage, companies can create an advertisement and rotate it at regular intervals.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">8.
